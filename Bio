I'm a focused strategic communication major at High Point University.
I am currently learning about the crucial, intricate, art of translating ideas across all industries and platforms. 
With the doc.com 2.0 turning the corner, I spend my time researching and practicing the virtual trade of goods both physical and non-fungible.
I am looking to collaborate in a start-up enviornment where I can feel matched in passion and drive to enchance the bright future of digitalization.
